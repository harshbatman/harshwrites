    excerpt: "It started as a simple efficiency upgrade. But let me tell you, it ended as a massive headache. You know how everyone thought it was a brilliant idea to separate the \"thinking\" from the \"making\"?",

      <p>See this picture? JFK, Nixon, Reagan, Obama, Biden, Trump — and that big red word screaming LOSERS. Harsh? Maybe. Wrong? Not entirely.</p>

      <p>Now you might say, "That’s a bold claim. America invented globalisation. Silicon Valley, free markets, WTO — that was their playbook."</p>

      <p>Exactly. They wrote the rules. Then forgot to read the fine print.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">🌍 Globalisation: The Original Deal</h3>

      <p>You might ask, where did it all start going wrong?</p>

      <p>Let’s rewind to 1972. Richard Nixon lands in China. Big moment. Cold War thaw. Handshakes. Photos. History.</p>

      <p>Now you will tell me, "At that time, China was poor. Rural. Barely industrial."</p>

      <p>True. But America wasn’t opening China out of charity. The logic was simple: “We design. They manufacture. Everyone wins.” Cheap labour for American companies. Higher profits. Lower prices. Wall Street loved it.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">🏭 The Manufacturing Exit</h3>

      <p>And what about factories?</p>

      <p>Gone. One by one. Detroit → Shenzhen. Ohio → Guangdong. America decided manufacturing was “low value”. Finance, software, and services were “the future”.</p>

      <p>But China didn’t see it that way.</p>

      <p>Exactly. China saw factories as power.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">⚙️ Semiconductors: The Fatal Assumption</h3>

      <p>Now you will say, "But semiconductors? That’s high-tech. America still dominates there."</p>

      <p>Design? Yes.</p>
      <p>Manufacturing? That’s where the mistake lies.</p>

      <p>America assumed fabs were just another factory. Dirty. Expensive. Low glamour. China assumed fabs were strategic weapons. So Beijing subsidised. Planned. Protected. Waited.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">🧩 Meanwhile, America…</h3>

      <p>So what did the U.S. do?</p>

      <p>Quarterly profits. Stock buybacks. Outsourcing.</p>

      <p>Presidents changed. Policies didn’t.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reagan trusted markets.</li>
        <li>Clinton doubled down on free trade.</li>
        <li>Bush focused on wars.</li>
        <li>Obama hoped supply chains were “too global to break”.</li>
        <li>Trump noticed the problem — too late, too loud.</li>
        <li>Biden is now trying to rebuild what was dismantled for 40 years.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">🏗️ China’s Long Game</h3>

      <p>And China?</p>

      <p>Five-year plans. Technology transfer. Local champions. Manufacturing scale.</p>
      <p>They didn’t just make toys and shoes. They climbed — steel → electronics → chips → EVs → AI hardware.</p>
      <p>Globalisation didn’t accidentally help China. China used it deliberately.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">🧠 The Real Lesson</h3>

      <p>So you ask, who really failed?</p>

      <p>Not one president. Not one policy. The failure was believing that making things doesn’t matter.</p>

      <p>America designed the world. China built it.</p>
      <p class="story-punchline">And in semiconductors — the brain of modern power — the country that builds eventually decides.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">🧾 Final Punchline</h3>

      <p>So this image calling them “losers”...</p>

      <p>It’s not about humiliation. It’s about warning.</p>

      <p>Globalisation rewards those who produce, not just those who promise.</p>

      <p class="story-punchline">America taught the world how to globalise. China learned how to win from it.</p>

    excerpt: "Every time someone talks about growth, it’s always the same story: 'Let’s build factories.' But Raghuram Rajan asks us to take a hard look at what we’re doing.",

      <p>Every time someone talks about growth, it’s always the same story: “Let’s build factories. Let’s make things. Let’s attract big companies.”</p>

      <p>Now you will say, "Yeah, Make in India, PLI, incentives — you name it. And now Apple’s iPhone production sites and Foxconn get talked about like they’re the holy grail of jobs and development."</p>

      <p>Exactly. But then Raghuram Rajan asks us to take a hard look at what we’re doing. In his interview with The Wire, he argues that we should value services just as much as manufacturing — and invest accordingly — because that’s where our people and our future might actually lie.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">But What About Apple and Foxconn? Big Money Flows Here…</h3>

      <p>Now you might think, "Okay, but surely bringing Apple to make iPhones here is great! Doesn’t that create wealth?"</p>

      <p>It does some — but let’s unpack it. The Indian government — both Centre and states — has been offering huge incentives and subsidies to attract companies like Apple’s supplier Foxconn as part of schemes like the PLI (Production Linked Incentive) and state ESDM policies.</p>

      <p>For example:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Under Karnataka’s Electronics System Design and Manufacturing incentives, Foxconn is set to get about ₹6,970 crore in subsidies as part of support for its iPhone-related manufacturing plant.</li>
      <li>Across India, the government pledged around ₹41,000 crore (about $4.8 billion) in manufacturing subsidies under the PLI program — some of which is earmarked for Foxconn and others.</li>
      <li>In recent years, Foxconn reportedly received roughly ₹2,450 crore (≈ $295 million) in direct subsidies from the central incentive scheme alone.</li>
      <li>And Foxconn has poured about $1.5 billion (~₹12,500 crore) into its Indian capacity expansion.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="story-punchline">So we’re talking about subsidy flows in the thousands of crores — numbers big enough to make anyone blink.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Great Numbers — But What Do We Get in Return?</h3>

      <p>Now you will say, "I mean, export numbers are huge too, right? Apple iPhones made here have crossed $50 billion in exports during the latest PLI period."</p>

      <p>Yes — exports are impressive. But here’s the point Rajan makes: These are capital-heavy, technology-intensive operations where most big profits flow back to corporate headquarters abroad, and the number of direct jobs per rupee invested isn’t as high as we often assume.</p>

      <p>Think of it like this — a factory might churn out billions in value, but employ far fewer people than an equivalent investment in healthcare workers, teachers, software developers, designers, consultants, logistics specialists, and other service talent.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Rajan’s Central Argument: Services Are Not Second-Class</h3>

      <p>So does that mean Rajan is saying we’re focusing too much on manufacturing?</p>

      <p>Yes — but not that manufacturing is bad. His point is: If we subsidise factories billions of dollars, why don’t we also subsidise people — our human capital — so they can sell services from India to the world, without tariff and trade-war problems?</p>

      <p class="story-punchline">Services — like healthcare, education, technology, digital content, finance, design, professional services — don’t face the same kind of tariff walls, and our young population can compete globally from right here.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Where Could That Money Go Instead?</h3>

      <p>Like… invest in people?</p>

      <p>Exactly. Here are some ideas:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><strong>Upskilling & Vocational Training</strong> — Tech skills, language training, digital literacy, AI/ML courses.</li>
      <li><strong>Healthcare Infrastructure</strong> — More trained professionals means better health outcomes and global demand for tele-medicine or specialised services.</li>
      <li><strong>Education & Research</strong> — World-class institutions to attract foreign students or collaborative research (think service exports in education).</li>
      <li><strong>Creative & Digital Services</strong> — Software development, animation, content creation, consultancy — sectors where Indians already excel.</li>
      <li><strong>SME and Gig-Economy Support</strong> — Micro loans, incubation, digital platforms that connect small service providers globally.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">The Real Question We Need to Ask</h3>

      <p>So it’s not just “manufacturing or services”?</p>

      <p>It’s about balance. Rajan reminds us that development isn’t just about machines and factories. It’s about people, skills, ideas, and adaptability.</p>

      <p>If we’re willing to spend thousands of crores on factory subsidies, why not spend similarly on human resource development that lets our youth sell services to the world — without worrying about trade wars or tariffs?</p>

      <p>Because services — unlike physical goods — are:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Less exposed to heavy tariff walls</li>
      <li>More adaptable with remote work</li>
      <li>Often higher value per worker</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Conclusion</h3>

      <p>We’ve been telling ourselves:</p>
      <p class="story-punchline">“Manufacturing is the engine of jobs.”</p>
      <p>But maybe we should say:</p>
      <p class="story-punchline">“People are the engine of jobs.”</p>

      <p>And if our subsidies and policies don’t reflect that belief, we’re not seriously investing in our future — we’re just chasing shiny factory icons.</p>

      <p>We should ask ourselves: If we can give crores to factories, why not invest equally in our people who can serve the world from right here?</p>

      <p class="story-punchline">That’s the uncomfortable but important conversation Rajan is pushing us toward — and it’s one we need to have honestly.</p>

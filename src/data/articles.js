      <p class="story-punchline">It started as a simple efficiency upgrade. But let me tell you, it ended as a massive headache.</p>

      <p><span className="drop-cap">Y</span>ou know how everyone thought it was a brilliant idea to separate the "thinking" from the "making"? For almost thirty years, that really was the playbook. The plan was simple: America would handle the cool stuff—research, design, software—and shipment of the actual manufacturing would go to wherever it was cheapest. On paper? Ideally, it made total sense. Costs went down, profits went up, and consumers got cheaper gadgets.</p>

      <p class="story-punchline">But here’s the thing: technology doesn’t play by those rules forever.</p>

      <p>Eventually, it became clear that making things isn't just some back-office chore; it's actually where the power lies. Think about it. When you build chips or devices, you’re not just assembling parts. You’re building a whole ecosystem of suppliers, engineers, and know-how. And once you send that away? The innovation goes with it. Turns out, trying to design something without knowing how to build it makes you slower and, frankly, pretty vulnerable.</p>

      <p class="story-punchline">Factories aren't just pumping out products. They're pumping out leverage.</p>

      <p>Now, China? They figured this out way before the West. While American companies were obsessing over quarterly earnings, China was busy building the real stuff—semiconductor plants, logistics, raw materials. None of that was an accident. It was a calculated move to own the entire chain.</p>

      <p class="story-punchline">One side was chasing quick profits. The other was playing for keeps.</p>

      <p>You can see where this is going, right? This whole approach started showing cracks when everything became digital. Suddenly, chips weren't just for computers; they were running cars, weapons, AI, everything. What we thought was just a "supply chain detail" turned into a full-blown national security nightmare.</p>

      <p class="story-punchline">When it really matters, having access beats having it cheap.</p>

      <p>Then the pandemic hit, and oh boy, did that wake everyone up. Factories shut down halfway across the world, and suddenly nothing could be made. All those "just-in-time" systems? They collapsed. There was zero buffer because being prepared was considered "inefficient."</p>

      <p class="story-punchline">They saved money on efficiency but paid the price in chaos.</p>

      <p>It’s not that trading with the world is bad. It’s that it was done blindly. Markets are great at finding the lowest price, but they don't care about security or "what if" scenarios.</p>

      <p class="story-punchline">Markets want profit. Nations want to survive.</p>

      <p>So, look around now. Governments are scrambling—subsidizing chip plants, blocking exports, basically trying to undo thirty years of outsourcing. It’s not the end of globalization, but it’s definitely a reality check. The world finally admitted that some things are just too important to let someone else handle.</p>

      <p class="story-punchline">Globalization isn’t dead. But doing it with our eyes closed? Yeah, that’s over.</p>

      <hr style="margin: 3rem 0; border: 0; border-top: 1px solid #e5e7eb" />

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1.5rem">And then, there’s us.</h3>

      <p class="story-punchline">We watched this whole mess unfold and took some serious notes.</p>

      <p>For the longest time, we were basically the world's IT support. Great at software and services, but watching from the sidelines when it came to making hardware. We saw exactly what happened to America when it gave up its factories.</p>

      <p class="story-punchline">Being a software giant without hardware muscle? That’s a trap.</p>

      <p>We realized we couldn't make the same mistake. So instead of just looking for the cheapest option, we’re taking the harder road. You see us pushing for semiconductors, defense manufacturing, electronics—all the heavy lifting. It’s messy and slow, but we know we need it.</p>

      <p class="story-punchline">It’s not about ruling the world. It’s about having options.</p>

      <p>While some trusted markets to self-correct, we are using the government to nudge things in the right direction. Incentives, policies, homegrown tech—it’s all about not being dependent on anyone else. We learned the hard lesson that when the chips are down (literally), you need to be able to stand on your own.</p>

      <p class="story-punchline">Efficiency is nice to have. Independence is a must-have.</p>

      <p>There’s another lesson here too: making things is addictive. Once you start building, you attract more talent, more money, better suppliers. If you miss that boat, good luck trying to catch up later.</p>

      <p class="story-punchline">You can't control the future if you don't control the tools.</p>

      <p>We might not be making the absolute cutting-edge chips just yet, but we’re getting into the game—packaging, assembly, design. The unsexy stuff that actually keeps the world running.</p>

      <p class="story-punchline">Control the boring parts, and you control the outcome.</p>

      <p>The past few years proved that having great ideas isn't enough anymore. In this world, you need to own the idea *and* the factory that builds it.</p>

      <p class="story-punchline">Whoever owns the stack, owns the future.</p>

      <p>And let me tell you, we aren't planning on sitting this one out.</p>

    excerpt: "Every time someone talks about growth, it’s always the same story: 'Let’s build factories.' But Raghuram Rajan asks us to take a hard look at what we’re doing.",
    content: \`
      <p><strong>Person A:</strong> Every time someone talks about growth, it’s always the same story: “Let’s build factories. Let’s make things. Let’s attract big companies.”</p>

      <p><strong>Person B:</strong> Yeah, Make in India, PLI, incentives — you name it. And now Apple’s iPhone production sites and Foxconn get talked about like they’re the holy grail of jobs and development.</p>

      <p><strong>Person A:</strong> Exactly. But then Raghuram Rajan asks us to take a hard look at what we’re doing. In his interview with The Wire, he argues that we should value services just as much as manufacturing — and invest accordingly — because that’s where our people and our future might actually lie.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">But What About Apple and Foxconn? Big Money Flows Here…</h3>

      <p><strong>Person B:</strong> Okay, but surely bringing Apple to make iPhones here is great! Doesn’t that create wealth?</p>

      <p><strong>Person A:</strong> It does some — but let’s unpack it. The Indian government — both Centre and states — has been offering huge incentives and subsidies to attract companies like Apple’s supplier Foxconn as part of schemes like the PLI (Production Linked Incentive) and state ESDM policies.</p>

      <p>For example:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Under Karnataka’s Electronics System Design and Manufacturing incentives, Foxconn is set to get about ₹6,970 crore in subsidies as part of support for its iPhone-related manufacturing plant.</li>
      <li>Across India, the government pledged around ₹41,000 crore (about $4.8 billion) in manufacturing subsidies under the PLI program — some of which is earmarked for Foxconn and others.</li>
      <li>In recent years, Foxconn reportedly received roughly ₹2,450 crore (≈ $295 million) in direct subsidies from the central incentive scheme alone.</li>
      <li>And Foxconn has poured about $1.5 billion (~₹12,500 crore) into its Indian capacity expansion.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="story-punchline">So we’re talking about subsidy flows in the thousands of crores — numbers big enough to make anyone blink.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Great Numbers — But What Do We Get in Return?</h3>

      <p><strong>Person B:</strong> I mean, export numbers are huge too, right? Apple iPhones made here have crossed $50 billion in exports during the latest PLI period.</p>

      <p><strong>Person A:</strong> Yes — exports are impressive. But here’s the point Rajan makes: These are capital-heavy, technology-intensive operations where most big profits flow back to corporate headquarters abroad, and the number of direct jobs per rupee invested isn’t as high as we often assume.</p>

      <p>Think of it like this — a factory might churn out billions in value, but employ far fewer people than an equivalent investment in healthcare workers, teachers, software developers, designers, consultants, logistics specialists, and other service talent.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Rajan’s Central Argument: Services Are Not Second-Class</h3>

      <p><strong>Person B:</strong> So Rajan is saying we’re focusing too much on manufacturing?</p>

      <p><strong>Person A:</strong> Yes — but not that manufacturing is bad. His point is: If we subsidise factories billions of dollars, why don’t we also subsidise people — our human capital — so they can sell services from India to the world, without tariff and trade-war problems?</p>

      <p class="story-punchline">Services — like healthcare, education, technology, digital content, finance, design, professional services — don’t face the same kind of tariff walls, and our young population can compete globally from right here.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Where Could That Money Go Instead?</h3>

      <p><strong>Person B:</strong> Like… invest in people?</p>

      <p><strong>Person A:</strong> Exactly. Here are some ideas:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><strong>Upskilling & Vocational Training</strong> — Tech skills, language training, digital literacy, AI/ML courses.</li>
      <li><strong>Healthcare Infrastructure</strong> — More trained professionals means better health outcomes and global demand for tele-medicine or specialised services.</li>
      <li><strong>Education & Research</strong> — World-class institutions to attract foreign students or collaborative research (think service exports in education).</li>
      <li><strong>Creative & Digital Services</strong> — Software development, animation, content creation, consultancy — sectors where Indians already excel.</li>
      <li><strong>SME and Gig-Economy Support</strong> — Micro loans, incubation, digital platforms that connect small service providers globally.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">The Real Question We Need to Ask</h3>

      <p><strong>Person B:</strong> So it’s not just “manufacturing or services”?</p>

      <p><strong>Person A:</strong> It’s about balance. Rajan reminds us that development isn’t just about machines and factories. It’s about people, skills, ideas, and adaptability.</p>

      <p>If we’re willing to spend thousands of crores on factory subsidies, why not spend similarly on human resource development that lets our youth sell services to the world — without worrying about trade wars or tariffs?</p>

      <p>Because services — unlike physical goods — are:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Less exposed to heavy tariff walls</li>
      <li>More adaptable with remote work</li>
      <li>Often higher value per worker</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem;">Conclusion</h3>

      <p>We’ve been telling ourselves:</p>
      <p class="story-punchline">“Manufacturing is the engine of jobs.”</p>
      <p>But maybe we should say:</p>
      <p class="story-punchline">“People are the engine of jobs.”</p>

      <p>And if our subsidies and policies don’t reflect that belief, we’re not seriously investing in our future — we’re just chasing shiny factory icons.</p>

      <p>We should ask ourselves: If we can give crores to factories, why not invest equally in our people who can serve the world from right here?</p>

      <p class="story-punchline">That’s the uncomfortable but important conversation Rajan is pushing us toward — and it’s one we need to have honestly.</p>

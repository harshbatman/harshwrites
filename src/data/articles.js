      <p>Every American president here believed globalisation would automatically keep America on top.</p>

      <p>But instead, it taught China how to beat them at their own game.</p>

      <p>Exactly. Globalisation wasn’t a charity scheme. It was a classroom. China was the most serious student.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #111827; font-weight: 700;">The Beginning: When the Door Opened</h3>

      <p>People forget how intentional this was.</p>

      <p>1972. Richard Nixon visits China.</p>

      <p>America’s thinking was simple: “Trade will change China.”</p>

      <p>What they didn’t consider: China would change trade instead.</p>

      <p>Factories moved. Supply chains shifted. Costs fell. Profits exploded. Wall Street celebrated. Main Street slowly disappeared.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #111827; font-weight: 700;">Manufacturing Wasn’t ‘Low Skill’. It Was Leverage.</h3>

      <p>Now you see, America treated factories like old baggage.</p>

      <p>China treated them like national infrastructure. That difference matters.</p>

      <p>Because when you make things, you learn:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>how parts fit</li>
        <li>how costs fall</li>
        <li>how defects disappear</li>
        <li>how scale works</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Design without manufacturing is theory. Manufacturing turns theory into dominance.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #111827; font-weight: 700;">The iPhone Lesson Everyone Ignored</h3>

      <p>Let’s talk about phones. That’s where people really see it.</p>

      <p>It acts as the perfect example.</p>

      <p>The iPhone was revolutionary. Designed in California. Assembled in China.</p>

      <p>China didn’t just assemble it. They studied it.</p>

      <p>They learned:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>supply chain orchestration</li>
        <li>precision manufacturing</li>
        <li>component optimisation</li>
        <li>ecosystem thinking</li>
      </ul>

      <p>And then something predictable happened.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #111827; font-weight: 700;">Copy → Improve → Outnumber</h3>

      <p>Chinese companies didn’t waste time.</p>

      <p>Zero time.</p>

      <p>They copied fast. Then improved faster. Then produced at insane scale. Not just one brand — dozens.</p>

      <p>The result? Phones that were:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>cheaper</li>
        <li>“good enough”</li>
        <li>tailored for our wallets, our networks, our usage</li>
      </ul>

      <p>Meanwhile, American companies stayed premium. Exclusive. Expensive.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #111827; font-weight: 700;">Today’s Reality (No Emotion, Just Facts)</h3>

      <p>Look around us.</p>

      <p>Exactly. Most people around us don’t use iPhones. They use Chinese smartphones.</p>

      <p>Not because of nationalism. Because of value.</p>

      <p>China didn’t just dominate manufacturing. It dominated distribution, pricing, and iteration speed.</p>

      <p>Globalisation gave them access. They converted access into advantage.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #111827; font-weight: 700;">Semiconductors: Same Story, Higher Stakes</h3>

      <p>Phones are visible. Chips are invisible.</p>

      <p>And that’s why America slept on it.</p>

      <p>Semiconductors power everything:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>phones</li>
        <li>cars</li>
        <li>missiles</li>
        <li>AI</li>
        <li>satellites</li>
      </ul>

      <p>America stayed strong in design. But manufacturing? Outsourced. Neglected. Delayed.</p>

      <p>China watched this pattern once. They’re repeating it again — slower, harder, but deliberately.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #111827; font-weight: 700;">Meanwhile, America…</h3>

      <p>So what did the U.S. do?</p>

      <p>Quarterly profits. Stock buybacks. Outsourcing.</p>

      <p>Presidents changed. Policies didn’t.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Reagan trusted markets.</li>
        <li>Clinton doubled down on free trade.</li>
        <li>Bush focused on wars.</li>
        <li>Obama hoped supply chains were “too global to break”.</li>
        <li>Trump noticed the problem — too late, too loud.</li>
        <li>Biden is now trying to rebuild what was dismantled for 40 years.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #111827; font-weight: 700;">America’s Core Mistake</h3>

      <p>So where exactly did America go wrong?</p>

      <p>They believed three dangerous ideas:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Markets will fix everything</li>
        <li>Manufacturing doesn’t matter anymore</li>
        <li>No one will challenge us at scale</li>
      </ul>

      <p>China believed none of these.</p>

      <p>They believed:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>scale creates power</li>
        <li>learning beats innovation over time</li>
        <li>control beats efficiency in crises</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #111827; font-weight: 700;">And Where Do We Fit In?</h3>

      <p>Now you will ask, "This isn’t just America vs China, is it?"</p>

      <p>No. It’s about us.</p>

      <p>We don’t buy Chinese products because they’re Chinese. We buy them because they’re available, affordable, and improving.</p>

      <p>That’s the uncomfortable truth.</p>
      
      <p>Globalisation doesn’t reward morality. It rewards who shows up every day to build.</p>

      <p>So this image calling American presidents “losers”...</p>

      <p>It’s not about mocking leaders. It’s about exposing a system-level failure.</p>

      <p class="story-punchline">America taught the world how to globalise. China learned how to dominate it. And the world — including us — buys from the one who delivers.</p>

      <p>Every time someone talks about growth, it’s always the same story: “Let’s build factories. Let’s make things. Let’s attract big companies.”</p>

      <p>Now you will say, "Yeah, Make in India, PLI, incentives — you name it. And now Apple’s iPhone production sites and Foxconn get talked about like they’re the holy grail of jobs and development."</p>

      <p>Exactly. But then Raghuram Rajan asks us to take a hard look at what we’re doing. In his interview with The Wire, he argues that we should value services just as much as manufacturing — and invest accordingly — because that’s where our people and our future might actually lie.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #111827; font-weight: 700;">But What About Apple and Foxconn? Big Money Flows Here…</h3>

      <p>Now you might think, "Okay, but surely bringing Apple to make iPhones here is great! Doesn’t that create wealth?"</p>

      <p>It does some — but let’s unpack it. The Indian government — both Centre and states — has been offering huge incentives and subsidies to attract companies like Apple’s supplier Foxconn as part of schemes like the PLI (Production Linked Incentive) and state ESDM policies.</p>

      <p>For example:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Under Karnataka’s Electronics System Design and Manufacturing incentives, Foxconn is set to get about ₹6,970 crore in subsidies as part of support for its iPhone-related manufacturing plant.</li>
      <li>Across India, the government pledged around ₹41,000 crore (about $4.8 billion) in manufacturing subsidies under the PLI program — some of which is earmarked for Foxconn and others.</li>
      <li>In recent years, Foxconn reportedly received roughly ₹2,450 crore (≈ $295 million) in direct subsidies from the central incentive scheme alone.</li>
      <li>And Foxconn has poured about $1.5 billion (~₹12,500 crore) into its Indian capacity expansion.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="story-punchline">So we’re talking about subsidy flows in the thousands of crores — numbers big enough to make anyone blink.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #111827; font-weight: 700;">Great Numbers — But What Do We Get in Return?</h3>

      <p>Now you will say, "I mean, export numbers are huge too, right? Apple iPhones made here have crossed $50 billion in exports during the latest PLI period."</p>

      <p>Yes — exports are impressive. But here’s the point Rajan makes: These are capital-heavy, technology-intensive operations where most big profits flow back to corporate headquarters abroad, and the number of direct jobs per rupee invested isn’t as high as we often assume.</p>

      <p>Think of it like this — a factory might churn out billions in value, but employ far fewer people than an equivalent investment in healthcare workers, teachers, software developers, designers, consultants, logistics specialists, and other service talent.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #111827; font-weight: 700;">Rajan’s Central Argument: Services Are Not Second-Class</h3>

      <p>So does that mean Rajan is saying we’re focusing too much on manufacturing?</p>

      <p>Yes — but not that manufacturing is bad. His point is: If we subsidise factories billions of dollars, why don’t we also subsidise people — our human capital — so they can sell services from India to the world, without tariff and trade-war problems?</p>

      <p class="story-punchline">Services — like healthcare, education, technology, digital content, finance, design, professional services — don’t face the same kind of tariff walls, and our young population can compete globally from right here.</p>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #111827; font-weight: 700;">Where Could That Money Go Instead?</h3>

      <p>Like… invest in people?</p>

      <p>Exactly. Here are some ideas:</p>

      <ul>
      <li><strong>Upskilling & Vocational Training</strong> — Tech skills, language training, digital literacy, AI/ML courses.</li>
      <li><strong>Healthcare Infrastructure</strong> — More trained professionals means better health outcomes and global demand for tele-medicine or specialised services.</li>
      <li><strong>Education & Research</strong> — World-class institutions to attract foreign students or collaborative research (think service exports in education).</li>
      <li><strong>Creative & Digital Services</strong> — Software development, animation, content creation, consultancy — sectors where Indians already excel.</li>
      <li><strong>SME and Gig-Economy Support</strong> — Micro loans, incubation, digital platforms that connect small service providers globally.</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #111827; font-weight: 700;">The Real Question We Need to Ask</h3>

      <p>So it’s not just “manufacturing or services”?</p>

      <p>It’s about balance. Rajan reminds us that development isn’t just about machines and factories. It’s about people, skills, ideas, and adaptability.</p>

      <p>If we’re willing to spend thousands of crores on factory subsidies, why not spend similarly on human resource development that lets our youth sell services to the world — without worrying about trade wars or tariffs?</p>

      <p>Because services — unlike physical goods — are:</p>
      <ul>
      <li>Less exposed to heavy tariff walls</li>
      <li>More adaptable with remote work</li>
      <li>Often higher value per worker</li>
      </ul>

      <h3 style="font-family: var(--font-serif); font-size: 1.5rem; margin-top: 2rem; margin-bottom: 1rem; color: #111827; font-weight: 700;">Conclusion</h3>

      <p>We’ve been telling ourselves:</p>
      <p class="story-punchline">“Manufacturing is the engine of jobs.”</p>
      <p>But maybe we should say:</p>
      <p class="story-punchline">“People are the engine of jobs.”</p>

      <p>And if our subsidies and policies don’t reflect that belief, we’re not seriously investing in our future — we’re just chasing shiny factory icons.</p>

      <p>We should ask ourselves: If we can give crores to factories, why not invest equally in our people who can serve the world from right here?</p>

      <p class="story-punchline">That’s the uncomfortable but important conversation Rajan is pushing us toward — and it’s one we need to have honestly.</p>
